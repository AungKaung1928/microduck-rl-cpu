"""Shared constants and model loading for the Microduck CPU project.

The robot is the Pollen Robotics / Hugging Face "Microduck": a 25 cm, ~740 g
open-source biped with 14 position-controlled servos. Upstream trains it with
mjlab + MuJoCo Warp, which requires CUDA. This box has no GPU, so everything
here runs the same MJCF in plain CPU MuJoCo.

Three model variants matter, and they are the whole reason this project can
make a sim-to-sim claim later:

    walk            the nominal model, 14 actuated joints, nothing else
    walk_backlash   the same robot with a passive backlash joint added in
                    series with every actuated one (nq 21 -> 35)
    rollers         nominal plus passive roller geoms at the ground contact

All three expose the SAME 14 actuators under the SAME names in the SAME order.
So a policy trained on `walk` can be evaluated on `walk_backlash` with no
remapping at all -- the observation layout changes, the action layout does not.
That is the held-out physics for the domain-randomisation step, and it is
supplied by the robot's own authors rather than invented here.

    the robot falls, so what happens afterwards never has to be physical. It
    makes `walk` the wrong model for anything involving lying on the ground or
    getting back up, and the failure is silent -- nothing errors, the robot
